## DSA Practice / Problem Solutions

This repository contains my Data Structures & Algorithms practice solutions across Java and C++ (and a few other languages). It documents my learning path and provides a consistent structure so others (and future me) can easily browse, run, and verify solutions.

Contents

- `Arrays/`, `sorting/`, `Strings/`, `2d_arrays/`, etc. — language-specific folders containing solutions.
- `SOLUTION_TEMPLATE.md` — template each solution should follow.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — how to add solutions and PR expectations.

How this showcases my skills

- Organized by topic and difficulty so reviewers can find examples of specific patterns.
- Each solution includes an explanation, complexity analysis, and sample tests.
- A CI workflow compiles Java/C++ solutions to ensure they build.

Repository conventions (follow these when adding solutions)

- File naming: `<ProblemName>.<ext>` (use CamelCase or snake_case consistently).
- Add a small comment header in-code with problem name, source/link, difficulty.
- Include a short `README` entry in the folder for large topic collections.

Quick run examples

- Java (compile & run a single file):

  javac path\to\Problem.java
  java -cp path\to Problem

- C++ (compile & run):

  g++ -std=c++17 -O2 path/to/problem.cpp -o problem.exe
  ./problem.exe

Next steps

- Use `SOLUTION_TEMPLATE.md` when adding new files.
- Consider pinning this repo on your GitHub profile and adding a concise `profile-readme.md` to your profile.

Happy coding — keep solving consistently and add short write-ups for tricky problems!
