# Hi â€” I solve DSA problems and learn algorithmic patterns ðŸ‘‹

I'm practicing Data Structures & Algorithms with focused topic folders in this repo. I work through problems in Java and C++ and add short write-ups explaining my approach and complexity analysis.

What I practice

- Arrays, Two Pointers, Sliding Window
- Sorting, Searching, Recursion
- Hashing, Prefix-Sums, Two-Pointers
- Dynamic Programming, Graphs (ongoing)

Why this repo

- Clear folder-by-topic structure so employers and collaborators can quickly find examples.
- Each solution includes an explanation and sample tests.

Highlights

- Language: Java / C++ primary
- Over X solved problems (update this as you progress)

Pinned projects

- (1) array-sorting-examples â€” sample algorithms implemented and compared
- (2) interview-problems â€” curated set of common interview problems
